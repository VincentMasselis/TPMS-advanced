Hello üëã and thanks for contribution to TPMS-Advanced ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Each vehicle has its own dedicated background image, to avoid consistent issues, each image must be designed with the same styling rules :
- [ ] Schematic top view
- [ ] Not too much details
- [ ] Transparency
- [ ] ~1.5 px lines
- [ ] Wide and big picture, more than 500x1000

If you need some inspiration, you can check the [actual background image used](https://github.com/VincentMasselis/TPMS-advanced/blob/develop/feature/core/src/main/res/drawable/schema_car_top_view.webp) for a car.
